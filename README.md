## Description

As leader of the Israeli submarine Tekumah, Commander Gilad has the sole authority to launch nuclear-tipped cruise missiles against cities housing millions. But while out at sea, the unthinkable occurs. Devastating nuclear explosions in Israel and attacks against Israeli embassies destroy any chance of peace in the Middle East.

Following the attacks, Gilad has no way to receive orders from civilian or military authorities, and must draw on all his training to lead his men and decide how and when to retaliate. Faced with a lengthy mission, food and fuel shortages, a fire, and an attack by a surface ship, Gilad struggles to maintain order.

As tensions rise, Gilad must persuade his own officers and crew, as well as the vengeful commander of a second Israeli submarine, of the path he has chosen. Sharon, a feisty female intelligence officer onboard, staunchly supports him as well as heroic crew members who stand ready to make the ultimate sacrifice. Now, with millions of lives at stake, Gilad has some hard choices to make, ones that may very well decide the fate of the free world.

## Reviews

### ★★★★★ Fast-Paced and Realistic

"The novel was hard to put down. The fast pace helped me to stay focused on the plot, where other books of this genre can side track the reader with subplots and too much minute detail"

\- Tim H. Rasmussen

### ★★★★☆ Armageddon has been thrust upon the Holy Land

"Golden delivers an extremely thorough accounting of the weapons and submarine systems, lacking nothing in clarity and detail. Techno-nerds will revel the in the deployment of scutter torpedo decoys, submarine operating procedures, and the way Golden weaves the hardware into the action without bogging down the storyline. Depth of Revenge is very much a submarine story, with all the tensions and tactics that are attendant with submarine battles, set against a backdrop so realistic, one might wonder if Golden has a visit from Homeland Security in his future."
