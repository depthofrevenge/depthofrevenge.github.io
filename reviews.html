<p class="light">Fast-Paced and Realistic, March 12, 2009</p>
<p class="light">By Tim H. Rasmussen</p>

<p>I usually confine my reading in this genre to books by Clancy, Brown, Baldacci or Flynn. However, the topic of this book <br>
seemed timelier than many other current military fiction novels, so I purchased a copy of Depth of Revenge. <br>
</p><p>
At only 192 pages, the book was a quick and easy read. The author included only the relevant details about the workings of<br>
the submarine, its systems and weapons, without the minute detail featured in other novels of this type. Since the book was <br>
written in the first person and almost entirely took place aboard the submarine, it gave me the unique perspective of a commander<br>
 having to make decisions based on limited outside information. Near the end of the book, the reader finds out more about what happened<br>
 outside the submarine, than the commander knew at the times of the various important events. <br>
</p><p>
The plot was straightforward and didn't involve wild assumptions about future technology or unbelievably skilled secret agents.<br>
The commander ended up in a position where he is cut off from communication with Israel, after it is attacked with nuclear <br>
weapons. After the authorities outside Israel are also killed, he had to rely on a letter written by the Prime Minister to <br>
decide the extent of retaliation to pursue. The decision was further complicated by realistic events, such as an attack by an <br>
enemy helicopter, an onboard fire, and the need to obtain additional food and fuel. He had to also see his crew's unity and discipline<br>
suffer, as the mission lasts many months without the prospect of ever returning home. <br>
</p><p>
The novel was hard to put down. The fast pace helped me to stay focused on the plot, where other books of this genre can side track <br>
the reader with subplots and too much minute detail. I also found the first person perspective worked well, as it let the reader see <br>
the submarine captain's decision-making process. I recommend Depth of Revenge to anyone who is interested in books that deal with <br>
realistic military fiction or current world events.
